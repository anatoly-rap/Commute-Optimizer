# Commute-Optimizer
This is a ML project that optimizes a commute. Using time of day, speed, and distance. This is a early first commit which just reads in the logged GPS data and maps it to a heatmap. To develope the model, multiple trips on the same path at different times of day are needed. 

# Current Application:

# Future Features:
  - Linear Regression model to predict best time to make commute.
  - Driver behavior catagorization based on acceleration and turn agression
