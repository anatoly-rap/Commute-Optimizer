# Commute-Optimizer
This is a ML project that optimizes a commute. Using time of day, speed, and distance. This is a early first commit which just reads in the logged GPS data and maps it to a heatmap. To develope the model, multiple trips on the same path at different times of day are needed. 

# Current Application:

![opt](https://github.com/anatoly-rap/Commute-Optimizer/assets/102273751/2db6b4ca-e7f0-4203-9204-4f3f556586b6)


# Future Features:
  - Linear Regression model to predict best time to make commute.
  - Driver behavior catagorization based on acceleration and turn agression
